### About me

I am an experienced IT Generalist with a strong track record in Software Engineering, Solutions Architectecture and commercial management.

I work as a developer for Grounds and Services Ltd, Christchurch. We are a small team with a broad remit, with everything from integrations, process automation and digitisation, to consuming detailed GPS and signal data to track equipment position and operation.
